# Problem-set-2
# **Cognitive and Neuroimaging Data Analysis for Causal Inference and Prediction**

## **1. Overview**
This repository contains code for analyzing **cognitive assessment and neuroimaging data**, focusing on understanding **spatial memory performance and cognitive rehabilitation effectiveness** using **machine learning models and causal inference techniques**.  

The project is structured into **three core components**:  
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Analysis** â€“ Extracting linguistic features from cognitive assessments.  
2. **Prediction Models** â€“ Using **supervised learning** to predict cognitive outcomes from hippocampal data.  
3. **Regression Discontinuity (RD) Analysis** â€“ Estimating the **causal effect** of cognitive rehabilitation eligibility (age â‰¥ 65) on **spatial memory performance**.  

This project integrates **machine learning, neuroimaging, and causal inference** to explore the relationship between **cognitive function, linguistic expression, and intervention effectiveness**.

## **3. Prerequisites**
Before running the analysis, ensure that you have the following software installed:  

### **Required Software**
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Anaconda (recommended for dependency management)**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)

### **Required Python Libraries**
These can be installed using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or manually install the key dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn transformers torch
```

## **4. Usage Instruction**

### **Local Setup**

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cognitive-research.git
cd cognitive-research
```

**Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment**
Using Anaconda:
```
conda create --name cognitive-env python=3.9
conda activate cognitive-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## **5. Running the Analysis**

### **A. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
Ensure you have cognitive assessment data and neuroimaging data available. If working with synthetic data, run:
```
python data_simulation.py
```

### **B. NLP Analysis**
Extract linguistic features from autobiographical memory recall tasks using transformer-based NLP models:
```
python nlp_analysis.py
```
Expected outputs:

- Sentiment scores
- Lexical complexity analysis
- Syntactic structure extraction

### **C. Training Prediction Models**
Predict cognitive outcomes based on hippocampal subfield data using Random Forests and Neural Networks:
```
python prediction_models.py
```

Expected outputs:
- Model performance metrics (RÂ², MSE, accuracy)
- Feature importance analysis
- Predicted cognitive scores based on linguistic & neural features

### **E. Robustness Checks**
To validate RD findings, conduct placebo tests and density tests:

**Placebo Test (Age 62)**
```
python placebo_test.py
```
Expected Output: No significant treatment effect at age 62, validating RD design.

McCrary Density Test
```
python density_test.py
```
Expected Output: Even distribution of ages across the cutoff, confirming no manipulation of the running variable.

## **6. Expected Outputs**
After running the full analysis, the following insights are generated:

### **A. NLP & Prediction Models Performance**
| Model            | Accuracy / RÂ² | Key Insights |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Random Forest   | 85%          | Predicts spatial memory based on hippocampal structure |
| Neural Network  | 88%          | Captures non-linear relationships in cognitive data |
| NLP Sentiment   | N/A          | Extracts linguistic markers of cognitive flexibility |

### **B. RD Analysis**
Treatment Effect (Age 65 Cutoff): +3.65 increase in spatial memory scores.
Natural Aging Decline: -0.1446 per year decrease in spatial memory performance.
Placebo Test at Age 62: No significant effect, confirming the validity of RD assumptions.
McCrary Density Test: No evidence of manipulation, supporting a valid RD design.

### **C. Visualization Outputs**
Scatter Plot of Spatial Memory Performance vs. Age
Regression Line Fitting for RD Analysis
McCrary Density Test Histogram
